# Natural-Language-Processing-Tensorflow

## Tensorflow 
> A computational framework for building machine learning models. TF provides a variety of toolkits that allow you to construct models at your preferred level of abstraction. You can use low-level APIs to build models by defining a searies of mathematical operations. Alternatively, you can use higher-lever APIs(like tf.estimator) to specify predefined architectures, such as linear regressors or neural networks.
